      <p>
        Hi, my name is Jingchao Zhou and I’m currently a software engineer at
        Nuro. Prior to joining Nuro, I was a software engineer intern at
        Mastercard and Nutanix. I graduated from UC Berkeley with an M.Eng.
        degree in EECS. As an undergraduate, I majored in computer science and
        economics and minored in mathematics at Duke University. Some of my
        areas of interest in CS include IoT, machine learning, augmented
        reality, and distributed systems. When I’m not busy with work, I enjoy a
        number of other hobbies and activities in my free time — especially
        skiing, cooking, and traveling. For any questions or comments, please
        feel free to contact me!
